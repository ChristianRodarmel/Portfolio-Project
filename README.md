# Portfolio-Project
Portfolio Project (starting with the Catty Corner Cafe)
So this is the first project that will be displayed for the portfolio.

The intent is to showcase a responsive layout that highlights fun unique features, along with the incorporating JS necessary to make it functional
The hope is to have it tied into a second project which will be a menu for a "Cafe/Bistro" which will be inside this one.

Will update this as follows.
